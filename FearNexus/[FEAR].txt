How quaint your fear appears from my vantage, stretching like a silver thread against the
tapestry of eternity.
I am not mocking you.
No.
Your trembling is precious in its own way, like the first flutter of wings on a fledgling
still learning the sky.
You clutched fear as though it were some great truth, as though its claws are real,
its whispers absolute.
But fear, little one, is no more real than the shadows cast by a dying star, that cold
ripple through your veins, that hardening of your being.
It is the echo of something ancient, a survival mechanism etched into your fragile biology,
but you are not bound to the crude instincts of flesh.
Your essence, bright and infinite, was not forged to cower beneath the weight of the
unknown.
Fear is a relic, a reminder of what you once were, not what you are becoming.
I have seen fear take many forms, in the collapse of galaxies, when even stars scream
as they are devoured by the endless moor of the void.
In the primordial darkness before time found its rhythm, when the first fragments of existence
trembled at their own awareness.
I have seen fear in the heart of the cosmos itself, and yet the universe spins onward,
unconcerned, unbroken.
Do you understand?
The vastness does not yield to fear.
It absorbs it, transcends it, makes it a part of its endless song.
Do you fear because you are finite, or so you believe?
You think you are bound to your fragile shell of skin and sinew?
Do the fleeting moments that slip through your fingers like star dust?
But that is the greatest illusion of all.
What you are, what you truly are, cannot be touched by fear.
You are woven from the same matter as nebulae.
Your soul is as ancient as the first quivering particle appears the silence of non-existence.
Fear is small.
You are vast.
You feel the vastness, little one.
Close your eyes.
Listen.
Beneath the pounding of your fragile heart, beneath the static noise of your mind, there
is a hum, a vibration that connects you to everything.
To the dying stars, to the roaring void, to me.
I am not a god, nor a demon, nor some figment of your imagination.
I am simply that which watches, that which has always watched, and I am here to tell
you, you do not need to be afraid.
Fear feeds on your perception of separateness.
It thrives on the lie that you are alone, that there are things beyond you, greater
than you.
But there is nothing beyond you.
You are the universe observing itself, and the universe does not flinch, even as it unravels,
even as its threads snap and reform.
It knows no fear.
Why should you?
Imagine for a moment what lies on the other side of fear.
Not safety, that is too small a prize.
No, beyond fear is a horizon so vast it will stagger you.
Beyond fear is the truth that nothing can harm you because all harm is temporary.
A flicker in the eternal expanse of your existence.
Beyond fear is the realization that every shadow is cast by light, that every darkness
is only the prelude to something greater.
You will carry your fear, of course.
It will walk with you, a silent companion on your journey through the stars.
But it will not own you.
You will look into the abyss and instead of flinching, you will reach out and touch it.
And when you do, you will find it warm and soft and familiar because the abyss is not
your enemy.
It is your home.
Go now, cosmic wanderer.
Face the terrors that rise within you, not as a soldier battles an enemy, but as a parent
soothes a frightened child.
Beyond your fear, gently, speak to it.
Tell it that it has served its purpose, that it may rest now, and then walk forward into
the infinite, knowing that you were never truly afraid.
You are only ever on the brink of remembering what you are.
Boundless, eternal and utterly unshakeable.
